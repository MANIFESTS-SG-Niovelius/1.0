The Niovelius serious game has been developed to help crisis managers deal with accidental HNS pollution.
Trainees apply to become investigators in a team specialised in the fight against pollu-criminals responsible for serious crimes against the seas and oceans.
The aim is to understand the issues related to pollutants spilled in the maritime environment and to learn the different phases of crisis management, by working in a collaborative manner. 
Niovelius is a hybrid game based on both physical elements and a digital application designed to multiply learning methods and encourage playfulness
